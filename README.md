Synoptic Project for Group 7

To pull the project, go to the repository tab within vscode (third down), click clone repository, and paste in the HTTPS link from the green "Code" button.

To run the server locally, you must install nodejs (https://nodejs.org/en). Following this, open a new terminal within vscode, and write in "npm i" to install other required packages.

Once complete, you can write in "npm run dev" to start the server, and use localhost:8080 to preview changes.

To push your changes to the repository, go to the same tab you used to clone the repository, and stage your changes by clicking the plus icon next to each changed file. Once selected, you can commit the changes, then sync to the repository.
